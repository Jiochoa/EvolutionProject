# Evolution Project
The following is a description of the plot of the application as well as ideas for future expansions.
## Plot
The idea of the game is to learn Evolution through natural selection while playing a fun game. 
The game will give the player controlling the environment and the enemy will be the organisms trying to survive.

1. The user will control the environment (ENV) and will be against a single organism (ORG). 

2. The organism will be given a set time to evolve strong before the user can attack it.
3. The user will attack the organism with natural events, starting with small ones, which will have a short cool downs, to larger ones, which will have long cooldowns. 
4. The enemy will be affected in two ways, the enemy's life will shorten but its resistances will increase. 
5. The more the user uses the same attack the more resistance the enemy will get to that attack. Therefore the user needs to vary their attacks for greater damage to the enemy. 




### Future Works
Have the organism fight other organisms emphasizing an evolutionary race. Ex: cuckoos vs. robins
